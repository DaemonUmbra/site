# Relationship to MCP

MCP is composed of several portions.

The "MCMappings" project is healthy. This is the piece that provides the translation from obfuscated to srg naming,
and makes the code compile. The forge project (mostly Lex) has been maintaining this for some time.

The MCP data project - the part that people have contributed to over the years - was a crowdsourced
effort to name every srg element. This underlying database (which knows about every element for naming) has not been
updated for some time.

Updates to the database to allow for new versions had become laborious and complex, and there
are few people with the knowledge or skill to make such changes, leading to us finally being unable
to update the database so new crowdsourcing contributions can be accepted at all.

We have permission to grandfather in the crowdsourced names to a new project from the original
owners of MCP. This is what we plan to do. The modmapping crowdsourced data will be pre-populated with
the last version of MCP data.
